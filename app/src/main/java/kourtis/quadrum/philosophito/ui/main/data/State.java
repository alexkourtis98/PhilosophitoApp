Agency relationships are ubiquitous features of business because they permit both individuals and companies to conduct business and enter into contractual relationships in many different places at the same time.

The third is the idea that production within the economic system is reflective of demand: what goods or services are produced, and in what quantity, is in some way a function of what the purchasing public wants, rather than (for example) of what a ruler or government agency decides should be produced.", "https://conciseencyclopedia.org/entries/capitalism/"));
