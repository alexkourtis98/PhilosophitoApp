#### What is Kantian Ethics?

Kantianism is
a [Deontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology) [normative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics)
ethical theory. Something is evaluated as right with regards to the intentions of the moral agent.
Something is not right or wrong because of the consequences of one's actions; nor because of the
impact that actions have oneself on others. Morality is not rooted in desires or emotions but in
reason, from which moral precepts or duties are founded. Kantian ethics are a set of universal moral
principles that apply to all human beings, regardless of context or situation.

#### Kant's Definition of Morality

Kant's moral philosophy is
a [deontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology) [normative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics)
theory, which is to say he rejects the [utilitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism)
idea that the rightness of an action is a function of how fruitful its outcome is. He says that the
motive (or means), and not consequence (or end), of an action determines its moral value. To live
ethically, one must never treat another human being as a means to some greater end. Human beings, by
virtue of their unique ability to reason, are different from other forms of physical existence.

Kant wrote that "without rationality, the universe would be a waste, in vain, and without purpose."
The only way to preserve such consciousness, which is unique to the universe or at least the Earth,
is by treating all humans as ends in and of themselves. It's alright to eat food to satiate hunger,
but stealing is wrong as it deprives the owner of her private property.

Kant advocates a stringent notion of morality, which demands that virtue is universal. Stealing is
immoral regardless of one's circumstance. Murder is wrong even in the case of self-defense. It is
this objectivity that remains Kant's most remarkable yet disputed idea, as it challenges the basis
of civilization since Aristotle.

However, Kant is not a masochist or an anarchist. He understands that for civilization to exist, a
student must use herself as a means to get good grades and her professor as a means to amass
knowledge. This is where he introduces the idea of respect being essential to humanity, which is
different from sentiments like love, sympathy, or altruism. Respect doesn't discriminate like love.
One is human and, therefore, one deserves respect. Kant called it the Formula for Humanity, and it
remains, by far, his least controversial formulation.

#### Moral versus the Non-moral Framework

- Kant distinguished between the Hypothetical imperative and the Categorical Imperative

- The [Hypothetical imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_imperative) reflects a
  non-moral framework Of the form: if x, then y.

- The [Categorical Imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative) reflects a
  moral framework Of the form: y.

#### The Hypothetical imperative

- The Hypothetical imperative "the practical necessity of a possible action as a means to something
  else that is willed (or at least which one might possibly will).”

- Or put more simply: it is a practical imperative that springs from desire, and which is
  conditioned on means of its achievement determined by one’s understanding of the causal world of
  sense perception.
- If I want to lose weight, then I must exercise and adopt a healthier diet. Weight loss = desire
- Exercise & healthy diet = means to achieve the desire which one comes to calculate as a rational
  being familiar with the workings of the world.
- The moral issue of right and wrong does not come up. The only issue that arises is the question of
  the most efficient means of achieving one’s desired ends.

#### The Categorical Imperative

- The Categorical Imperative [i.e., an imperative based on reason alone]  is one that represents "an
  action as objectively necessary in itself apart from its relation to a further end”.
- Or put more simply: it is a moral imperative that springs from Reason,
- Categorical imperatives are categorical, or in other words, absolute or unconditional, because
  they are independent of any of these contingent considerations that concern practical matters with
  regards to how, in fact, we do and can, live our lives and make everyday decisions, but which do
  not reflect what we should morally do.
- As unconditional imperatives, these are absolute - they follow as a matter of necessity from
  Reason, can be known a priori (prior to experience) and apply with absolute necessity to all
  rational beings no matter what.

- Kant derives a test to determine a categorical imperative. He says, "Act only in accordance with
  that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law." It means
  that an idea can be only be exposed when applied to everyone. Cheating on a test can only be moral
  when everyone else's cheating on a test is justified. However, in a practical sense, a mass
  cheating scandal will eradicate trust in the system of meritocracy, which will lead to a breakdown
  of educational institutions.

- To conclude, cheating on a test is immoral. According to Kantian ethics, categorical imperatives
  are counterintuitive in the sense that even though human beings may be inclined to act in
  self-interest, their actions must be driven by their duty to humanity. Kant considered
  self-improvement and preservation to be an undebatable obligation that is placed on everyone.
  Therefore, unproductivity, suicide, or any form of self-destruction is inherently immoral.

#### 1st formulation of the Categorical Imperative

- "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a
  universal law.”
- Or put more simply: When faced with a moral decision formulate that act as a general rule that
  could be made a universal law.
- The Categorical Imperative is sometimes referred to as the principle of universalizability.
- The question is would it be self-defeating to adopt said duty, and not what would be the impact on
  people in the world were we all to adopt this rule (that would be a form of utilitarianism).
- If something is wrong it is always wrong, for all people, at all times, in all places.

#### 2nd Formulation of the Categorical Imperative

- Kant offered a number of formulations of the Categorical Imperative. Here’s the 2nd formulation:
- “Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of
  any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.”
- Or put more simply: All self-conscious rational beings are moral agents for whom moral discourse
  is both meaningful and possible, and it is as a moral agent that I acknowledge myself as an end –
  namely as a self-legislating being, that makes choices that ”determine” the fate of my life.
  Someone of moral integrity will not demean or devalue him/herself by failing to recognize oneself
  as a rational being and allowing oneself to fall under the sway of internal forces (emotions,
  insecurities) and/or external forces (other people, existing paradigms of oppression).
- As a rational being this acknowledged understanding is something that also extends to all fellow
  self-conscious rational beings. Hence, all rational beings have the absolute moral duty to
  acknowledge and respect fellow rational beings as ends in themselves.
- Acknowledging in others that they are ends, namely self-legislating beings, requires that they
  never be treated merely as a means to one’s ends, but ends in themselves.

#### Don’t use others as a mere means!

- We use others as a means to an end all the time. For instance, we use employers as a means to
  providing a service. E.g. students use professors for their knowledge and as constituents towards
  the completion of their degrees, and professors use students as a means of earning an income.
- We merely use others when their value is acknowledged and administered exclusively in terms of
  their usefulness. That is, someone is valued as a mere means to my ends when I use them only to
  fulfill those (my) ends. So when a student considers and treats a professor merely as a means to
  his/her ends, then the professor will not be acknowledged as an end that can and does make choices
  as a rational being and thereby determines the fate of his/her life. In essence, his/her choices
  would not be a reflection of his/her free will.
- If then a student were to cheat on an exam, and thereby adopt actions of deceit, the professor
  would adopt actions (i.e. the assignment of a false grade) which s/he would not have otherwise
  done, were s/he given a choice. The student here values the professor only a means by which he/she
  can get what s/he wants (a good grade). This is a violation of the professor’s autonomy.

#### The heteronomous versus the autonomous

- Heteronomous = heteron meaning “other” & nomous meaning “rule” or “law”.
    - ther-ruled or other-governed.
- Autonomous – auto meaning “self” & nomous meaning “rule” or “law”.
    - self-ruled, self-legislative or self-governed.

#### Heteronomous

- The idea here is that one’s will is determined by factors that reside outside of or beyond the
  seat of free will and thereby leaves one compromised. Essentially one would be making decisions
  that are not a true expression of one’s free will.
- The seat of free will is Reason, and hence an expression of free will would also be an expression
  of the Categorical Imperative; a moral act that it determined by that maxim that can be willed to
  be a universal law.
- When I act from desire, which are contingencies that are relevant to my subjective investedness in
  the world, I am compromised. I am essentially allowing myself to be moved by matters that fall
  outside of my will determine my fate as a rational being.
- When I allow the opinions of others to weigh heavily on me, again contingencies get the better of
  me and impede my ability to make choices as an expression of my free will as a rational moral
  agent.
- When I allow the impact my decision might have on myself and others in the world, I allow external
  contingencies to inhibit y moral duty to decided my moral duty free from worldly affairs which
  speak to the descriptive “reality” regarding how things appear to our sensory experiences.
- Al these questions and issues are not or moral relevance, Kant argues. These are all practical
  concerns which are best answered by appealing to our understanding of the workings of the world
  and ourselves, but which do not speak to what one should do.

#### Autonomous

- The idea here is that one is a self-legislative being when one makes decisions that spring from
  Reason, and hence one is unimpeded or unhindered by events and circumstances that are mere
  contingencies which are, in fact, irrelevant to morality.
- One who is autonomous will also possess a good will, and adopt actions that are good in themselves
  and not because they are good for you or anyone else in and for a given set of circumstances.

#### Autonomy and Freedom

The [Critique of Pure Reason](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/) is considered history's most
comprehensive account of the determination of free will. Kant talked about freedom not as a
universal law set in concrete, but instead as something of one's own making. That is to say that
acting virtuously simply because one fears a penalty is self-defeating.

Free will goes beyond the pessimistic view of a "freedom from" external actors and becomes a "
freedom to" autonomously determine and impose moral requirements. It is similar to Jean Jacques
Rousseau's idea of freedom. When one acts in accordance with her desires or intuition, she is simply
acting to satisfy a necessity. This makes one a slave to impulse, and for Kant, freedom is the
opposite of necessity. His notion of freedom is therefore different from libertarianism, which
preaches one must possess the freedom to do as she pleases.

Critics argue that autonomy creates a space for subjectivity, as different principles might hold a
decisive authority over different people. Kant's response is simple -- rationality is universal,
regardless of one's personal experiences and circumstances. As long as morality is derived from
reason, there should be a fairly objective sense of what is virtuous and what isn't.
