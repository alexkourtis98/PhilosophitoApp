### Quick Summary

Utilitarianism is
a [teleological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology) [normative ethical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics#:~:text=Normative%20ethics%20is%20the%20study,act%2C%20in%20a%20moral%20sense.)
and as such seeks to resolve moral dilemmas by appealing to the consequences of the act in question.
Basically, an act is considered morally right when the net average happiness is greater for the act
implemented for the greatest number of affected beings. Affectability is calculated in terms of
pleasure or the absence of pain and for this reason Utilitarianism. is considered to be
a [hedonic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism#:~:text=Hedonism%20refers%20to%20a%20family,pleasure%20and%20to%20decrease%20pain.)
seeking the maximization of the experience of pleasure. Pleasure is therefore taken to be
objectively quantifiable, to which [Bentham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham) assigned
numerical value. Given the hedonic feature it is also noteworthy that any and all beings that
experience pleasure and pain be taken into account. Such beings are
called [sentient beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience) and it was Bentham's position that
because all sentient beings have the same and equal interest to avoid suffering that therefore from
a moral point of view equal consideration must be given to their interests to do so. As such no
one's pleasure or pain is determined to be more or less morally valuable than any others. That is,
equal weight shall be given to any and all sentient beings with regards to the impact that actions
have upon them irrespective of species race, sex, etc.

### In-Depth

#### Utilitarianism

-According to Utilitarianism, an action is right if that action produces the greatest amount of
happiness for the greatest number of persons

- [Consequentialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) theory: It determines rightness
  on the basis of the consequences achieved

- [Hedonistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism) theory: It connects happiness to pleasure

#### Four Theses of Utilitarianism

-Consequentialism: The rightness of actions is determined solely by their consequences.

- [Hedonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism): Utility is the degree to which an act produces
  pleasure/happiness. Hedonism is the thesis that pleasure or happiness is the good that we seek and
  that we should seek.

- [Maximalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximalism): A right action produces the greatest good
  consequences and the least bad.

- [Universalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalism): The consequences to be considered are
  those of everyone affected, and everyone equally.

#### The Greatest Happiness Principle

-"Everyone should perform that act or follow that moral rule that will bring about the greatest
good (or happiness) for everyone concerned".

-An act is right if it maximizes happiness/pleasure/benefit/profit, and/or it minimizes the
possibility of further unhappiness/pain/cost/loss for the majority of the people concerned with that
act.

#### Two types of Utilitarianism

- [Act-Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_utilitarianism): It determines rightness or
  wrongness of a single action/business policy solely on the basis of the principle of utility. As a
  more narrow cost-benefit analysis of overall happiness, it tends to promote the corporate
  interest.

- [Rule-Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_utilitarianism): It suggests that we
  should establish and follow those rules (types of actions) that will maximize overall happiness
  for the greatest number of people in the long term. A rule is morally valuable not in itself, but
  to the extent that it contributes to the long-term maximization of happiness. The theory may
  promote both the corporate and the general social interest.

#### The Utilitarian method of ethical reasoning

1. Accurately state the action to be evaluated.

2. Identify all those who are directly and indirectly affected by it.

3. Specify all the pertinent good and bad consequences of the action for all those directly affected
   -- as far into the future as seems appropriate -- and imaginatively consider various possible
   outcomes and the likelihood of their occurrence.

4. Weigh the total good results against the total bad results, considering such matters as the
   quantity and duration of the harms and benefits involved.

5. Carry out a similar analysis, if necessary, for those indirectly affected, and for society as a
   whole.

6. Sum up all the good and bad consequences. If the action produces more good than bad, the action
   is morally right; if it produces more bad than good, it is morally wrong.

7. Consider, imaginatively, whether there are various alternatives other than simply the action and
   carry out a similar analysis for each of the other alternate actions.

8. Compare the results of the various actions. The action that produces the most good (or the least
   bad) among those available is the morally proper thing to do.

#### Applicability of this approach in business

1. It promotes a cooperative spirit and the building up of trust

2. The cost-benefit analysis can be used for the resolution of financial problems

3. It is commonsensical and pragmatic

4. It promotes efficiency in agency relations

5. Rule-Utilitarians provide a good basis for constructing a corporate code of conduct (Rules of
   conduct)

6. Rule-Utilitarians promote Corporate Social Responsibility

#### Some problems with Utilitarianism

-The Act-Utilitarians may allow the use of any means as long as they are efficient for the end to
accomplish.

-Advantage-taking may be permitted if it benefits society as a whole. But people should not be
treated unjustly for others' gain.

-It may not be easy to anticipate the consequences of an action in the long-run.

-It is not morally sound to refer to consequences alone in order to determine the rightness or
wrongness of an action.

-Act-Utilitarians do not always promote corporate social responsibility. They may place the
corporate interest over and above the general social interest.

-Violation of personal rights and potentially of minorities' rights.
