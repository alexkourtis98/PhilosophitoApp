# Virtue Ethics
=============

Virtue ethics is a broad term for theories that emphasize the role
of [character](https://iep.utm.edu/moral-ch/) and virtue
in [moral philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/ethics/) rather than either doing one's duty or acting in
order to bring about good consequences. A virtue ethicist is likely to give you this kind of moral
advice: "Act as a virtuous person would act in your situation."

Most virtue ethics theories take their inspiration from [Aristotle](https://iep.utm.edu/aris-eth/)
who declared that a virtuous person is someone who has ideal character traits. These traits derive
from natural internal tendencies, but need to be nurtured; however, once established, they will
become stable. For example, a virtuous person is someone who is kind across many situations over a
lifetime because that is her character and not because she wants to maximize utility or gain favors
or simply do her duty. Unlike [deontological](https://iep.utm.edu/ethics//#SH2b)
and [consequentialist](https://iep.utm.edu/conseque) theories, theories of virtue ethics do not aim
primarily to identify universal principles that can be applied in any moral situation. And virtue
ethics theories deal with wider questions---"How should I live?" and "What is the good life?" and "
What are proper family and social values?"

Since its revival in the twentieth century, virtue ethics has been developed in three main
directions: Eudaimonism, agent-based theories, and the ethics of care. Eudaimonism bases virtues in
human flourishing, where flourishing is equated with performing one's distinctive function well. In
the case of humans, Aristotle argued that our distinctive function is reasoning, and so the life "
worth living" is one which we reason well. An agent-based theory emphasizes that virtues are
determined by common-sense intuitions that we as observers judge to be admirable traits in other
people. The third branch of virtue ethics, the ethics of care, was proposed predominately by
feminist thinkers. It challenges the idea that ethics should focus solely on justice and autonomy;
it argues that more feminine traits, such as caring and nurturing, should also be considered.

Here are some common objections to virtue ethics. Its theories provide a self-centered conception of
ethics because human flourishing is seen as an end in itself and does not sufficiently consider the
extent to which our actions affect other people. Virtue ethics also does not provide guidance on how
we should act, as there are no clear principles for guiding action other than "act as a virtuous
person would act given the situation." Lastly, the ability to cultivate the right virtues will be
affected by a number of different factors beyond a person's control due to education, society,
friends and family. If moral character is so reliant on luck, what role does this leave for
appropriate praise and blame of the person?

This article looks at how virtue ethics originally defined itself by calling for a change from the
dominant normative theories of deontology and consequentialism. It goes on to examine some common
objections raised against virtue ethics and then looks at a sample of fully developed accounts of
virtue ethics and responses.
