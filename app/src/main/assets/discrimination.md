Discrimination in the workplace is based on certain prejudices and occurs when an employee is
treated unfavourably because of gender, sexuality, race, religion, pregnancy and maternity or
disability.

If you treat someone differently because they possess different characteristics to other members of
staff you could be acting unlawfully. Direct discrimination occurs when someone is treated less
favourably than other employees. For example, the employee has the qualifications to do the job but
you turn them down because you think they might want to start a family soon.

Direct discrimination can also occur when you pay someone less than other employees for no good
reason,
you [select particular workers for redundancy](https://www.breathehr.com/en-gb/blog/topic/business-process/how-to-select-employees-for-redundancies)
based on protected characteristics, you don't make reasonable adjustments for a disabled worker, you
sack someone for making allegations of discrimination or you unfairly reject a request
for [flexible working](https://www.breathehr.com/en-gb/blog/topic/flexible-working/what-is-flexible-working)
from a new parent.

Indirect discrimination occurs when certain rules or regulations put certain staff members at a
disadvantage. For example, if you insist all workers should work Sundays, this could be seen as
discriminating against Christians who consider it a day of worship.

The Equality Act 2010 and protected characteristics
---------------------------------------------------

[The Equality Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents) brought together a
number of pieces of separate legislation under one banner and strengthened the laws around
discrimination. In the Act, nine protected characteristics are listed:

- Age
- Disability
- Gender Reassignment
- Sex
- Sexual orientation
- Religion or belief
- Race
- Marriage and partnership
- Pregnancy and maternity

If you do discriminate against your employees on one of these grounds, then they can make a
complaint against you or even take their case to court.
