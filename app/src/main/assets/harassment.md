Harassment For the purposes of this Policy, harassment is conduct, considered by the employer to be
unacceptable in the workplace, in which an employee exhibits offensive behaviour to another
employee, or group of employees, and where that individual knew, or ought reasonably to have known,
the behaviour would cause offence or harm. The harassment definition incorporates the following: -
Harassment may consist of verbal, written or physical behaviours employed directly (e.g. in person)
or indirectly (e.g. via social media). - A reasonable person would know that the harassing behaviour
is unwelcome. - Harassment generally stems from a pattern of offensive behaviour; however, it can
result from a one-time incident if that incident is reasonably severe. - Lack of intent to harass
does not alter a finding of harassment. - The person being harassed does not have to voice
objections for a harassment complaint to be established. - The prohibited behaviour does not have to
be directed at a specific employee; it can include the workplace in general, creating a poisoned
workplace environment. Workplace Rights Harassment Prevention Policy 4 This Policy includes
harassment based on a prohibited ground of discrimination specified under the Nova Scotia Human
Rights Act. These grounds consist of age; race; colour; religion; creed; sex; sexual orientation;
gender identity; gender expression; physical or mental disability; irrational fear of contracting an
illness or disease; ethnic, national or aboriginal origin; family status; marital status; source of
income; political belief, affiliation or activity; and an individual's association with another
individual or class of individuals having the characteristics of any of the prohibited grounds. This
Policy also extends to include workplace harassment not linked to a prohibited ground. 4.1.1 Types
of Harassment (a) Exclusion Exclusion involves shunning or ostracism of an individual, or group of
individuals. It can include, but is not limited to, isolating others by: - No longer communicating
with them. - Denying or ignoring their presence. - Distancing them from others. - Purposefully
omitting them from decisions, conversations, and workrelated events without valid reason. (b)
Physical Harassment Physical harassment involves any unwelcome physical behaviour including
threatening or offensive gestures, physical intimidation, coercion, assault, practical jokes or "
horseplay" that would reasonably result in embarrassment or humiliation. If initial analysis of the
complaint identifies that the alleged physical harassment involves a threat of physical harm or
actual physical harm has occurred, the complaint may be referred to Health, Safety & Wellness for
investigation under HRM's Workplace Violence Prevention Corporate Procedure. (c) Poisoned Workplace
Environment A Poisoned Workplace Environment occurs when inappropriate conduct is so frequent that
it results in a hostile or offensive workplace. The conduct may not be directed at anyone in
particular, but has the overall effect of creating an uncomfortable environment that negatively
affects well-being and productivity. A poisoned workplace environment can exist even if Employees
participate in, or do not object to, demeaning behaviour. Behaviours contributing to poisoned
workplace environments include, but are not limited to, the following: Workplace Rights Harassment
Prevention Policy 5 - Offensive graffiti or posting of inappropriate materials. - Sexual, racial,
and religious insults or jokes, including those regarding sexual orientation. - Abusive treatment of
other Employees, such as frequent name calling, insults or exclusion. - Intimidating actions such as
yelling, slamming doors, kicking desks or throwing objects. - Regular use of profanities and/or
abusive language, even if it not directed at a specific person. - Undermining other Employees'
reputations through malicious gossip, negative electronic postings or cyber-bullying. (d) Racial
Harassment Racial harassment is offensive behaviour based on the grounds of race, colour,
citizenship, place of origin, ancestry, ethnic background or creed that includes, but is not limited
to: - Derogatory communications, images or offensive stereotypical conduct (e.g. racial slurs,
ethnic jokes, insulting depictions, adverse differential treatment.) - Criticizing or being
intolerant to racial differences in appearance or customs. (e) Sexual Harassment Sexual Harassment
means any offensive or bothersome conduct or course of comment, gesture, or contact of a sexual
nature that would reasonably cause offense or humiliation. Sexual harassment also includes placing
conditions of a sexual nature on employment, training or promotional opportunities, as well as
receipt of services or contracts. Examples of unwanted behaviours that can constitute sexual
harassment include, but are not limited to, the following: - Unwanted physical contact including
hugging or touching. - Inquiries or comments about a person's sex life. - Telephone calls, e-mails,
notes, social media messages or other forms of communication with sexual overtones. - Gender or
sexual orientation based insults or jokes causing embarrassment or humiliation. - Unwanted or
repeated social or sexual invitations that a reasonable person would know to be unwelcome. -
Inappropriate or unwelcome attention, leering, or comments about a person's physical attributes or
appearance. - Reprisal or threat of harm, against an Employee for rejecting a sexual advance.
Workplace Rights Harassment Prevention Policy 6 (f) Verbal Harassment Verbal harassment is an
offensive course of demeaning comments directed at an Employee, or used in reference about an
Employee, that would reasonably undermine the reputation of that Employee in the workplace. Verbal
harassment includes insults, name-calling, threats, slurs, crude or degrading comments, innuendoes,
profanities and negative stereotyping that would reasonably cause offence. If initial analysis of
the complaint identifies that an alleged verbal threat involves references to physical harm, the
complaint may be directed to Health, Safety & Wellness for investigation under HRM's Workplace
Violence Prevention Corporate Procedure. (g) Written or Graphic Materials Written or graphic
materials include offensive graffiti, printed materials, notes, letters, e-mails and social media
messages; displaying or distributing personal or stereotypical derogatory or inappropriate
materials, pictures, jokes or cartoons that portray a person's personal or physical attributes in a
negative or humiliating manner. 4.2 Actions Not Considered Harassment While each complaint is
assessed on its own merits, the following examples of normal workplace functioning and interactions
would usually not be considered as harassment: - A disagreement. - A comment or action that is not
persistent or severe. - Interpersonal conflict between co-workers unless severe and prolonged. -
Changes in work location, co-workers or assignments. - Less than optimal management or supervision.

- A single comment or action, unless it is reasonably severe and has a lasting harmful effect. -
  Rudeness, unless it is extreme and persistent. - Stressful workplace conditions resulting from
  workload, technological change, or impending layoff. - Performance management. - Appropriate
  exercise of managerial authority. - Appropriate discipline. Workplace Rights Harassment Prevention
