What is a safe product?
-----------------------

A safe product is one that provides either no risk or a minimum acceptable level of risk, taking
into account the normal or reasonably foreseeable use of the product and the need to maintain a high
level of protection for consumers.

What is safe is therefore determined by considering all characteristics of the product, how it is
presented, the effect that it might have on other products it is likely to be used with, and the
consumers at risk when using it (especially children and the elderly).

For many product sectors there is specific safety legislation (covering, for example, toys,
electrical goods and machinery), which sets out more detailed safety requirements applicable to
those products. This legislation generally applies to both consumer and commercial products, but
sets out the same safety criteria.

Although the safety regulations set out safety in general terms, the interpretation and practical
guidance to compliance can be found in British or European standards (BS ENs). A producer can
generally choose to use relevant standards to demonstrate that the goods are safe.

Responsibility for compliance
-----------------------------

As stated above if you are involved in the supply of goods to consumers you are responsible for the
safety of the goods you supply. The level of responsibility depends on whether you are involved in
the actual production of the goods - where you are affecting the safety properties of the
products ('producers') - or merely involved with the supply ('distributors').

Obligations
-----------

If you are a producer(importer, manufacturer, own-brander, re-conditioner, etc) then you are
responsible for ensuring your products are safe and carry adequate instructions and warnings for
consumers to use them safely*.*

You will also need to undertake some form of 'conformity assessment procedure', which is the means
set out in the legislation by which the product is shown to be safe (such as by manufacturing to
standards or being assessed by a third party). The records of this (the technical documentation)
need to be maintained for at least ten years.

Once in the supply chain, a producer is also required to have measures in place to be able to
identify any risks or issues arising from a product's use so that urgent action can be taken quickly
and effectively to trace it and take the necessary corrective action (including issuing a recall).

If you are a distributor(wholesaler, retailer, etc) you must not supply goods that you believe are
dangerous. You are required to monitor the safety of the products you supply, passing on information
to the producer and cooperating with them if they advise you of a problem. The legislation also
requires you to retain records of supply, which must be kept for six years.

It is good practice as a distributor to request assurances from your supplier regarding compliance
with the relevant regulations and standards; if possible request up-to-date relevant test
certificates for the product.

Whatever role you fulfil, remember that ultimately you have a duty to ensure you only supply safe
products. This duty exists whether that product is intended for consumers or for commercial use.

It is a criminal offence to place on the market or supply unsafe products. You could face criminal
proceedings, with the consequent damage to your business.

Product liability
-----------------

In addition to the criminal law, product liability legislation gives consumers the right to sue for
damages for injury caused by defective products. Anyone injured by a defective product has rights,
whether or not the product was sold to them.
