### What is Corporate social responsibility (CSR)?

**Corporate social responsibility (CSR)** is a broad business concept. It usually describes a
company's commitment to carry out their business in an ethical way.

This means managing their business processes while taking account of their social, economic and
environmental impact, and considering human rights.

### Examples of corporate social responsibility

Corporate responsibility can cut across almost everything your business does. It can involve a range
of **CSR activities**, such as:

- environmental management, eg waste reduction and sustainability
- responsible sourcing, eg using only fair trade ingredients
- improvement of working standards and conditions
- contributing to educational and social programmes
- employee volunteering
- socially responsible investment
- development of employee and community relations

### CSR and stakeholders

Your stakeholders are the individuals or groups that have an interest in your business and are
influenced by your actions. Different CSR strategies can help you make a positive impact on
different groups of stakeholders, including:

- **Consumers** - eg through fair and open business practices and good customer relations. See how
  to [manage your customer service](https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/manage-your-customer-service "Best practice for managing your customer service")
  .
- **Suppliers** - eg by choosing your suppliers carefully, looking at their labour, health, safety,
  and environmental practices. See more

  .
- **Communities** - there are many ways to create positive change in the community, eg through
  sponsoring local events, taking part in charity initiatives, volunteering, etc.

- **Employees** - responsible business practices will often aim to do more than simply comply with
  the law.

Reducing your **environmental impact** through different CSR initiatives, such as waste and resource
management, can also greatly benefit your business. Read more

### Importance of corporate social responsibility

CSR can help you improve your business performance, increase competitive advantage and build trust
with customers and employees. It can also help you achieve operational cost savings, by avoiding
costs of wasted energy or unnecessary fees.

Perhaps most importantly, CSR gives your company and your brand a positive image of a reputable
ethical business. See more
