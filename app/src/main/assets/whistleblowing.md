#### **Definition of Whistle Blowing****:**

Whistle blowing basically is done by an employee where he finds that the ethical rules are broken
knowingly or unknowingly and an imminent danger for the company, consumers or the public. When an
employee is working in an organization is part of the group where the decisions are made and
executed.

The whistle blowing needs a relook at the same work and requires breaking with the very group that
the whistle-blower viewed as critical to financial success of the group and the company or very
survival of the company. The decision of whistle blowing may involve destabilizing one's life and
placing the entire organization under scrutiny.

ADVERTISEMENTS:

The attempt of an employee or former employee of an organisation to disclose what he or she believes
to be wrong doing in or by the organisation. Whistle blowing can be internal, external, personal,
and impersonal. Whistle blowing goes against the strong bonds in Indian companies and culture norms
of showing loyalty.

A moral dilemma can occur when a loyal employee observes the employer committing or assisting in an
illegal or immoral act and must decide what to do. The whistle blowing may not only lose his or her
job but may also experience negative effect on his career and personal life. The pressure on the
whistle-blower may range from outright termination to more subtle pressures.

**The conditions in which whistle blowing is morally justified are:**

1\. A product or policy that will commit serious and considerable harm to the public.

ADVERTISEMENTS:

2\. When the employee identifies a serious threat of harm to the consumers, employees, other
stakeholder, state and things against his or her moral concern.

3\. Immediate supervisor does not act, should exhaust the internal procedures and chain of command
to the board of directors. No action is taken in spite of best efforts of the employees to remedy
the situation of unethical actions.

4\. The employee must have documented evidence that is convincing to a reasonable level so that the
facts can be proved to the outside public and to the test of the law.

5\. Valid reasons to believe that revealing the wrongdoing to the public will result in the changes
in the organisation are necessary to remedy the situation. The chance of succeeding must be equal to
the risk and danger the employee takes to blow the whistle.

ADVERTISEMENTS:

The whistle blower should take care that the action should not be simple mudslinging or raising
alarm on inaccurate or unjustifiable grounds.

**The areas of special importance are:**

i. Confidential information of the company to maintain its competitive edge or perform work
efficiently.

ii. Whistle blower should not involve himself in personal acquisitions or bringing down the morale
of the organisation.

ADVERTISEMENTS:

iii. Accusing manager about incompetent decisions that do not involve ethical issues.

iv. Whistle blowing against violations of code of conduct of the company.

From the above it may be seen that a whistle-blower has to do his homework well and consider the
real consequences before blowing the whistle. It involves conflict between company goals, legal,
moral, personal issues. Before whistle-blowing one has to think of what alternatives available to
him and thereafter, follow proper guidelines in reporting the wrongdoing.

Freedom of speech is a fundamental right. But how far an employee can use this against own employer
depends upon the topic of grief, knowledge and maturity of the employee.

ADVERTISEMENTS:

Under what circumstances and against what type of activities can an employee below whistle against
his seniors or employer is important. Whistle blowing can be treated as questionable loyalty or
strongly worked suggestion. How to treat it depends upon the way it is presented and the broad
minded attitude of the management.

An employee will be in a moral dilemma whenever he finds that his employer is doing illegal or
immoral act and will be in confusion of future course of his action. A whistle blower risks his job
and sometime even future career. In Indian conditions there are various examples where an employee
complains to PF Commissioner or Income Tax Commissioner or Sales Tax Commissioner for violation of
act and loose the job in the process.

This brings in a situation where a whistle blower is branded as 'unfair' by employer but his
activities are 'fair' as per the law and as per his friends and family. Due to fear of losing the
job many employees avoid or delay whistle blowing. Most of them do it safely after changing the job.
This sometime could be too late to alert the authorities concerned.

#### **Justification of Whistle Blowing:**

There are certain situations when the whistle blowing can be justified.

ADVERTISEMENTS:

**There are:**

(1) Whenever and wherever the product/service of the firm will cause considerable harm to the
public.

(2) Whenever an employee feels serious threat or harm to him or anybody he should report to the
firm.

(3) Before reporting any subject an employee should have documental evidence which should convince
on impartial observer about the necessity of whistle blowing.

ADVERTISEMENTS:

(4) If an immediate boss does not care for report (whistle blowing) the employee should go up to
highest level to present his case.

(5) There is always some risk involved in whistle blowing. If the employee is fully convinced of his
good intentions and serves good cause for society he should go ahead with whistle blowing.

The risks of whistle blowing can be ill-treatment, withdrawal of perks, transfer, difficult work and
task and lastly termination. In some countries there is protection from termination to whistle
blowers. However this only helps to retain job. The management can always harass or trouble an
employee without termination. It is difficult to work in any company by going against the
management.

#### **Wrong Types of Whistle Blowers****:**

There are certain types of whistle blowers who do it on false accusations and with ill intentions.
Such employees should not be protected.

**Following instances show how freedom of speech is misutilised by the whistle blowers:**

(1) In case of disclosing business secrecy, inventions, future plans and some specific specialised
practices which may be confidential and of exclusive company usage.

ADVERTISEMENTS:

(2) Whenever an employee remarks are irrelevant to the organisations work and product.

(3) In case of wrong accusations which cannot be proved and which are made in vengeance only end up
demoralizing the employees.

(4) When an employee is complaining against transfer, demotion or discharge when such action is
taken on the basis of routine performance appraisal.

#### **Precautions before Whistle Blowing:**

Whistle blowing has consequences of moral, legal, personal, economic, family and career demands. It
is a serious step with definite consequences.

**Hence before blowing the whistle an employee should take following precautions:**

i. Be clear about your intensions and likely consequences. Go ahead only if you are convinced that
the situation warrants whistle blowing.

ADVERTISEMENTS:

ii. Compile documents to support your case. Do not depend upon hearsay.

iii. Allegations should be stated appropriately with documents and to be sent to the right person/
position.

iv. Preferably take the internal route. If this does not work then try external route.

v. Whistle blowing can be done openly or anonymously. If identity is disclosed are should be
prepared to face the consequences.

vi. Decide if it is appropriate to take action immediately after sometime later or during the
service.

vii. Consult a lawyer about possible legal battle and defence mechanism.

#### **Actions to Prevent External Whistle Blowing****:**

ADVERTISEMENTS:

Employers should organise grievance redressal systems. This will help employees to come forward with
grievances. The committee will attend the grievance and resolve them with the help of top
management. The external whistle blowing also can be taken up by the grievance committee.

**The following action will be reduce or prevent external whistle blowing:**

(1) Create an effective internal grievance system so that both present and past employees have no
reasons to complain.

(2) Appreciate employees and even adopt reward system for solving problems though grievance
redressal system.

(3) Keep special officers in each unit to study and evaluate wrong doings by various employees.

(4) Punish with heavy fines or retrenchment of employees who indulge in unlawful and corrupt
practices.

ADVERTISEMENTS:

It is always advisable to hire, train and promote morally and legally sensitive and responsive
managers who work for welfare of all the stakeholders. Whistle blowing should be a last resort to
awake the organisations.

An employee loyalty is best explained by trying to change for the better by gradual and persuasive
method rather than whistle blowing. None of the organisations can claim to be 100% ideal in all
aspects of employment and organisational working. Continuous efforts should be done in pursuit of
perfection.

**Empowerment of the Weakest, Unique and Balance of Power****:**

**On few occasions management takes complex issues of managing very weak and very talented
employees:**

**(a) ****Empowering Weak Employees:**

This situation calls for relocation, retraining and providing lighter or suitable work load.
However, this sounds more like a social resettlement. In commercial organisation the practice is to
force the VRS scheme or dismiss such employees. From employer point of view it is fair to the
company and concerned employee feels it unfair practice. Hence some issues are very delicate to
decide ethical or unethical.

ADVERTISEMENTS:

**(b) ****Empowerment of the Unique Employees:**

Unique employees are those who are (i) talented but not qualified or (ii) talented but not
experienced. The unique category needs to be encouraged. But this is difficult to do without
creating unequal employment practices. It is fair to encourage the talent but unfair to promote them
neglecting other colleagues. Hence this is also a delicate subject to decide ethical or unethical.

**Balancing the Situation****:**

There is no standard formula or theory to do balancing act on above two types of empowerment
situations. The situation depends on the company, work environment and the extent of trade union
activities. Decision has to be taken based on consensus opinion between management and the union. If
no consensus is arrived at the status quo continues.
