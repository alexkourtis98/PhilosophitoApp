Deceptive advertising is false advertising, and it is illegal according to the Federal Trade
Commission. It is also unethical. Other kinds of unethical advertising are neither deceptive nor
illegal; however, they offend moral principles of human conduct in terms of bad intent and effects.
Deceptive advertising is adjudicated in the courts. Ultimately, ethical advertising is regulated by
societal norms of acceptable advertising communications and the moral imperatives of advertisers.

Deceptive Advertising
---------------------

1. Deceptive or false advertising is prohibited under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, which is
   enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. Rooted in the principle that customers have a legal
   right to know precisely what they are buying, the Lanham Act establishes clear rules for false or
   deceptive advertising. Most states also regulate advertising through state consumer fraud and
   deceptive practice laws. Thus, there is no shortage of information on false or deceptive
   advertising as forbidden by federal and state statutes. Moreover, there is no excuse for
   small-business owners not to keep their advertising lawful.

Unethical but Lawful Advertising
--------------------------------

1. Unethical but lawful advertising is beyond the reach of law enforcement. It is more a matter of
   self-regulation. Ethical advertising is informed by an intuitive knowledge of right and wrong,
   commonly accepted as being innate to human nature. Consequently, self-regulation must be guided
   by an inherent respect for the dignity of other people. Where self-regulation fails, the
   community is empowered to enforce its norms for ethical advertising through patronage denial. One
   disgruntled consumer with access to the internet and social media can cause unwanted financial
   penalties to an advertiser that violates the community's ethical standards.

Truth and Personal Ethics
-------------------------

1. Truthfulness and the "highest personal ethics" are dominant themes for ethical advertising,
   according to the "Principles and Practices for Advertising Ethics" of the American Advertising
   Federation, Institute for Advertising Ethics. A normative term, such as "highest personal ethics"
   and the corresponding notions of "right" and "wrong," might seem unhelpful in a contemporary
   culture of moral relativism. However, Paul Boghossian, Philosophy Professor at New York
   University, says that concepts of right and wrong transcend moral relativism, because there are
   no moral equivalencies to right and wrong. This is why they have not been dumped into history's
   trash bin of failed concepts, according to Boghossian.

Vice --Virtue Continuums
-----------------------

1. Advertising has the mandate to persuade. Ethics describe the rules that govern peoples' behavior
   toward other people. Your challenge as a small-business advertiser is to reconcile the mandate to
   persuade within the rules of ethics. Dean Loftis, of Kansas City advertising agency McCormick &
   Company, suggests approaching the challenge by employing the seven deadly vices and their
   opposing virtues: Lust - Chastity, Gluttony - Temperance, Greed - Charity, Sloth - Diligence,
   Anger - Patience, Envy - Kindness and Pride - Humility. The vice - virtue continuum have
   imperceptible points that demarcate ethical and unethical advertising. You can always stay in
   safe territory by celebrating the virtues of human nature and by trusting your personal ethics
   for guidance.
